					<p><br />This is a video I made at Delta Marketing Group to accompany a mailer campaign we did to promote our custom designed calendars. We wanted to let people know how cost effective calendars are and how much visibility they provide brands.
					<br />I shot and edited our president talking, and animated the graphics you see which were designed by our graphic designer.</p>

					<p><br />Over the summer, we rolled out our new visual identity at Delta Marketing Group. In the past, we felt uninspired by our own promotional products. As a promotional products marketing company, we couldn't let this go. We refreshed our brand to breathe new life into our promotional products and inspire our employees.
					<br />I shot all the footage and animated the text. I helped come up with the story with the help of our marketing account manager. This was also the first time we had an animated logo. I created that new aspect of our brand in After Effects with the help of our graphic designer.</p>

					<p><br />Last year, we started a new tradition at Delta Marketing Group. Summer is a hard time for families in Vermont because so many rely on public school subsidized meals to help feed their children. That's why we started our annual Mindful Food Drive. We challenged our friends, families, and neighbors to donate entire meals for families and go beyond what they have lying around or a can they pick up at the grocery store. Last year we set a goal of 100 pounds of food and flew past that, donating almost 700 pounds. This year, we reached higher by adding an online campaign for donors who weren't local.
					<br />I was responsible for all the filming and editing on this project. Our marketing account manager wrote the script. Our graphic designer drew the graphics for me to animate.</p>

					<p>Every year, the LCDI sends a select group of students to Guidance Software&#039;s annual Enfuse Conference. This year, we asked students to reflect on their experiences. 
					<br />I filmed and edited all the interviews for this project. Our students filmed all the b-roll on GoPros.</p>

					<p>This is a social media video for the Leahy Center for Digital Investigation (LCDI). The goal was to recap to our followers the awesome year we&#039;ve had at the LCDI and thank all the people who engage with us.
					<br />Footage at the beginning is from High School Musical 2. All other footage was captured by me in the LCDI. All animation was done by me and the graphic at the end was made by our graphic designer.</p>

					<p>This short video is part of a series I did for my work-study position at the Senator Leahy Center for Digital Investigation (LCDI). We wanted to recognize students who go above and beyond and do amazing work. Brooke is one of those students. She works on the Bluetooth Forensics project, trying to analyze the security of Bluetooth connections and what data can be intercepted from a Bluetooth connection. 
					<br />On this project, I did all the filming, editing, and interviewing.</p>

					<p>This is a story I did at my internship at University of Vermont Extension's "Across the Fence" TV program, one of the longest running programs in the country. This story is about a fundraiser called Extra Life, a national organization that encourages healing through gaming. Each year they organize a 24-hour game day, where participants play games in order to bring awareness to their cause. Here in Vermont, Champlain College students play to support the University of Vermont Children's Hospital.
					<br />I filmed and interviewed all the subjects. I shot most of the b-roll. Hospital footage provided by WCAX-TV. I also wrote the story and provided the voice over.</p>
